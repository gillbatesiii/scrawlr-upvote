# Technical Assessment

## Setup
- Create a Codespace in Github
- Run the following commands in the Codespace terminal:

`npm install`

`npm run build`

`npm run preview --host`

Three empty UpvoteList components have been initialized in the app for testing. There is also a button to clear the Session Storage if needed.

The unit test for the selection change based on the click event can be found here:
